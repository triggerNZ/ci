#!/bin/bash
# This bash script manages building docker images in a standardized way for the
# CI pipeline.
#
# Default behavior is build all found Dockerfiles. Images are named by their
# containing directory path from the root.
#
# Names may be specified on the command line, if so, the build and push commands
# will be executed sequentially in order.
#
# The image tags are set from either the VERSION file in the current working
# directory, or from the TAG environment variable. Blank tags are not allowed
# and will fail the build. "latest" is explicitely filtered.
#
# RELEASE_BRANCHES environment variable can be set to an array of branches
# for which `docker push` should be allowed to run. By default it is set to
# `master`
# 
# Example Usage:
# ./ci/dockermake.bsh build myimage1 myimage2 --build-arg=someval
